    <h2>Problem: Lack of Accessible Preventive Dental Care</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p><strong>Who:</strong> Seniors who cannot access regular oral healthcare.</p>
      <p><strong>Where:</strong> Widespread issue but particularly prevalent in rural or low-income areas.</p>
      <p><strong>Why:</strong> Financial, geographic, and systemic barriers, as well as limitations in Medicare coverage.</p>
      <h3>Statistics and Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>96% of seniors experience dental caries (cavities).</li>
        <li>20% of seniors suffer from untreated dental decay.</li>
        <li>68% of older adults have periodontal (gum) disease, a major cause of tooth loss.</li>

  <!-- Early Conceptual Design Section -->
  <section class="section animate__animated animate__fadeIn" id="conceptual-design">
    <h2>Early Conceptual Design</h2>
    <p>We have developed a conceptual prototype of a mobile app for photo capture and integrated AI models with dental professionals. As shown in the figure below, the app consists of two main components: a front-end application that interacts with the user and a back-end server responsible for authentication, secure data storage, and analysis of the data.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The front-end app is developed using React Native, supporting both Android and iOS platforms.</li>
      <li>Users enter clinical information and capture images via guided prompts.</li>
      <li>AI-based models detect regions of interest (e.g., caries, ulcers) and segment the objects in less than 5 seconds.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The back-end server handles AI model processing, securely stores data, and ensures privacy.</p>

  <!-- Aim and Development Plan Section -->
  <section class="section animate__animated animate__fadeIn" id="development-plan">
    <h2>Aim and Development Plan</h2>
    <h3>AI Algorithm Development</h3>
    <p>We are developing a neural network algorithm that incorporates oral images to predict the risk of oral diseases by leveraging models like YOLO and SAM. Image features will be extracted using a ResNet50-based CNN.</p>
    <h3>Secure Server and Fairness Assessment</h3>
    <p>The server will handle tasks like segmentation, prediction model training, and secure data storage. We will also focus on fairness assessment through demographic representation analysis and bias mitigation techniques.</p>
    <h3>Web-Based Dashboard</h3>
    <p>A dashboard will allow administrative users to monitor system performance, bug reports, and user feedback in real-time, pulling data from the server's relational database.</p>
